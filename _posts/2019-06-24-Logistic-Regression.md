## Introduction

In this article, we are going over the theory behind the Logistic Regression. First, we cover the idea behind the Logistic Regression and we define what is the problem we have to optimize. In a second part, we cover how to implement the optimization of the Logistic Regression using Python. Finally, we gather all the parts and go over a classification example.
