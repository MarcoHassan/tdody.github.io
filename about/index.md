My name is Thibault Dody. I am a structural engineer with a strong background in mathematics. My current work focuses on performing risk analysis for nuclear power plants.<br>
<br>
I completed my MEng at MIT with a <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/82709">thesis</a> focused on applying numerical optimization techniques to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings. Before coming to MIT, I studied mathematics and physics as part of the preparatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles">program</a> to enter French engineering school. I then joined MSc <a href="https://www.estp.fr/en">ESTP</a> to study structural engineering.<br>
