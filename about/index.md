My name is Thibault Dody. I am a structural engineer with a strong background in mathematics. My current work focuses on performing risk analysis for nuclear power plants. 

I completed my MEng at MIT with a [thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/82709) focused on applying numerical optimization techniques to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings. Before coming to MIT, I studied mathematics and physics as part of the preparatory [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles) to enter French engineering school. I then joined MSc [ESTP](https://www.estp.fr/en) to study structural engineering.

You can read more about my past [projects](https://tdody.github.io/projects/) or obtain a copy of my [CV](http://tdody.github.io/docs/DodyResume.pdf).
